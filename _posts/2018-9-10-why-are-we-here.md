title: Resources and ramblings for would-be developers
---

I'm Maanav Shah and I started this blog as a resource to myself and others as a place to store useful information for the developing developer. I will share helpful information Iâ€™ve found useful in my pursuit for knowledge on a wide array of development topics, technologies, and languages.

My goal was to create this as a fairly simple & straight-forward way to repo this information both for myself and, perhaps more importantly, for anyone else out there whose path this makes a bit easier. I can recall technical hang-ups that have caused me to question and nearly abandon several side projects, but often I was able to find just the right resource (often via Stack Overflow, Google, etc.) after hours/days/weeks of scouring. Hopefully this blog can continue in that tradition and encourage the struggling everyday developer without all the answers.

Cheers,
