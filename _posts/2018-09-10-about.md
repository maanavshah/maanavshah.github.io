title: About me
---

A passionate programmer seeking opportunities with the ability to explore and solve problems. I enjoy building good software with a variety of programming languages, stacks, and frameworks, and participating in open source software and communities.

I’m a developer, hacker, engineer, enthusiast, multi-tasker, passionate programmer and a quick and perpetual learner who likes to work around like-minded people and learn from them.

Most of my personal projects can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/maanavshah">Github</a> and in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">Projects</a> section. Feel free to contact me by [Email](mailto:shah.maanav.07@gmail.com) or on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/MaanavShah">Twitter</a>.

A few things I know,

* Ruby on Rails ecosystem
* Object oriented programming and <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">Design Patterns</a>.

* *Technologies*  -   Ruby, Java, Cpp, C, Python, Android, Docker
* *Databases*     -   MongoDb, MySQL
* *Front-end*     -   Javascript, jQuery, Marionette.js, Backbone.js, Underscore.js

Quoting Moxie Marlinspike, *“I hope to contribute to a world where we value skills and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust cops or politicians, and where we’re passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way.“*
