I’m a developer, hacker, engineer, enthusiast, passionate programmer and a quick and perpetual learner, based in Pune, India.

I enjoy building good software with a variety of programming languages, stacks and frameworks, and participating in open source software and communities.

Most of my personal projects can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/maanavshah">Github</a> and in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">Projects</a> section. Feel free to contact me by [Email](mailto:shah.maanav.07@gmail.com) or on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/MaanavShah">Twitter</a>.

Quoting Moxie Marlinspike, *“I hope to contribute to a world where we value skills and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust cops or politicians, and where we’re passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way.“*
