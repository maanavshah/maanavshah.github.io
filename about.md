A passionate programmer seeking opportunities with the ability to explore and solve problems. I enjoy building good software by gaining intelligible insights from data that helps business-driven decisions and participating in open source software and communities.

- Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and DevOps enthusiast
- Open-source developer

A developer with a can-do attitude. Viewing any problem with a different angle and finding an innovative and fast track solution to it defines me.

I strongly believe that AI / ML is what the Internet was in the 1990s, hence now getting ready to hone my skills to be ready for the next wave of revolution

I’m a developer, hacker, engineer, enthusiast, multi-tasker, passionate programmer and a quick and perpetual learner who likes to work around like-minded people and learn from them.

Actively participate in open source contributions, communities, conferences, and meetups.
